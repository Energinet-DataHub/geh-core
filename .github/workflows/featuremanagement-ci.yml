  # This job is relevant to allow the status check for 'Publish bundle to NuGet.org' to execute
  # It's not pretty, but it's currently the path of least resistence if we want to enforce
  # running checks for Nuget publishes in a mono-repo with multiple CI builds where not all CI's
  # end up producing and pushing Nuget artifacts to Nuget.org
