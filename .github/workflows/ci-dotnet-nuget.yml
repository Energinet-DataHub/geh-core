name: Publish ProcessManager NuGet bundle(s)

# DESCRIPTION:
#
# - ProcessManager.Client depends on ProcessManager.Abstractions
# - ProcessManager.Orchestrations.Abstractions depends on ProcessManager.Abstractions
#
# To ensure the version of ProcessManager.Abstractions is the same for both when changed
# in the same PR, we must build all using the same workflow.
#
# We consider ProcessManager.Client and ProcessManager.Abstractions as a bundle, which means
# they must use the same version numbers. ProcessManager.Orchestrations.Abstractions is
# considered its own bundle and can be versioned in isolation.
#
# If ProcessManager.Abstractions has changed then both its consumers must have their
# versions updated.
