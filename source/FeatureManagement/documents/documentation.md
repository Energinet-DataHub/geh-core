# Documentation

This is a sample showing how we by use of the `Microsoft.FeatureManagement` NuGet package, and a few common guidelines, can support feature flags in an Azure Functions App.

It is meant to be a simple solution, as we aim for a minimum viable product. Even though the sample demonstrate feature flagging in an Azure Function App, the same code and principles should work with other C# applications, like an ASP.NET Core Web API.
