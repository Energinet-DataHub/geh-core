# Documentation

Notes regarding usage of the NuGet package `Energinet.DataHub.Core.FunctionApp.TestCommon` that is part of the `TestCommon` bundle.

The package contains reuseable code to help implementing xUnit tests of Energinet DataHub Azure Functions.

> We aim for documenting types using XML documentation comments, so be sure to also look at those.

For a concrete example of using this library to implement integration tests of a Azure Function, see the [Charges](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/geh-charges) repository/domain.




*TODO: Mention usage of the `functionapphost.settings.json`.*
